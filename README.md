# Mocumental

Directory based http server for testing.


## todo:

- CORS
- Web UI
- Route sorting
- isStatic and isDynamic stuff
- use built in routing API
- Human readable handler names. Move?
- Use chalk for colors and stuff
- rename paths to routes in mw?
- quit and show routes in cli?
- Care about accept types? Sounds like too much work for too little utility?
